            <p id="long">Katherine is in a position of authority over me and indeed everybody on the course. 
                True, I approached her and asked if I could host this week's Friday fun, but she did not have to say yes.
                As the Northcoders employee who encouraged this the blame can only lie with Katherine.
                If you need somewhere productive to direct further complaints I suggest the Northcoders website or the government.
